# CodePush

[CodePush](https://microsoft.github.io/code-push) is a cloud service that enables Cordova and React Native developers to deploy mobile app updates directly to their users' devices. It works by acting as a central repository that developers can publish updates to (JS, HTML, CSS and images), and that apps can query for updates from (using provided client SDKs for [Cordova](https://github.com/Microsoft/cordova-plugin-code-push) and [React Native](https://github.com/Microsoft/react-native-code-push)). This allows you to have a more deterministic and direct engagement model with your userbase, when addressing bugs and/or adding small features that don't require you to re-build a binary and re-distribute it through the respective app stores.

This repo includes the [management CLI](https://github.com/Microsoft/code-push/tree/master/cli) and [Node.js management SDK](https://github.com/Microsoft/code-push/tree/master/sdk), which allows you to manage and automate the needs of your Cordova and React Native apps. To get started using CodePush, refer to our [documentation](http://microsoft.github.io/code-push/index.html#getting_started), otherwise, read the following steps if you'd like to build/contribute to the project from source.

## Dev Setup

* Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
* Install [Git](http://www.git-scm.com/)
* Install Gulp: `npm install -g gulp`
* Clone the Repository: `git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/code-push.git`

### Building

* Run `npm install` from the root of the repository.
* Run `gulp install` to install the NPM dependencies of each module within the project.
* Run `gulp link-bin` to link CLI and SDK for local development and build the cli. It is advisable to do this step if you are making changes to the SDK and want the CLI to pick those changes.
* Run `gulp build` to build all of the modules. To build just one of the modules (e.g. cli or sdk), run `gulp build-cli` or `gulp build-sdk`.

### Running Tests

To run all tests, run `gulp test` script from the root of the project.

To test just one of the projects (e.g. cli or sdk), run `gulp test-cli` or `gulp test-sdk`

### Coding Conventions

* Use double quotes for strings
* Use four space tabs
* Use `camelCase` for local variables and imported modules, `PascalCase` for types, and `dash-case` for file names
